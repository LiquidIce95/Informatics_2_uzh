1.20 notice

one(1) = two prints
one(2) = 4*one(1) = 8 prints
one(3) = 8*one(2) = 64 prints

we can eliminate B, A , D  so it must be C 


1.21
just with T(1) = 1 we can eliminate C, now lets check T(2)=4

we eliminate A now check T(3)=11, so it must be D since B gives 13 for n=3



exercise 2

so wee dont need to be efficient so lets just use the naiive solution

we first store the even integers in an array , then we sort that array

then we iterate through the queeu and if the element is even we replace it 
with the current spot in the sorted array

reverseEven(Q):
    q2 = extract_even(Q)
    array = to_array(q2)
    array.sort()

    queue* next = Q
    int k = 0
    while next != null:
        if next.element is even:
            Q.element = array[k]
            k++
            next = next.next

this works because the amount of even integers in the queue and in the array are equal

ok but just read the rest of the task description...

so iterate through the queue Q and push the even elements to the stack S 
then we iterate again and pop the elements if we encounter an even element.


reverseEven(Q):
    queue* next = Q

    while(next != null):
        if(next.elmeent is even):
            S.push(next.element)
            next = next.next

    next = Q

    while(next != null):
        if(next.element is even):
            next.element = S.pop

    

Task2.2

O(n), for random integers, since worst case we still compare all integers 
if every integers has a 1/2 probability of being even then the expected value is n/2
pushes to the stack which is still O(n), for poppint the same

O(n), since we push every integer to the stack and pop then , as always 2n comparisons
so 3n is O(n)
O(n), comparisons still 2n, pusing and popping  O(1) so depending wether you
want to count comparisons or not O(n) or O(1)

task 3.1

these guys should be way more precise, T1 printed sorted and then T2 printed sorted

or sorted when we combine T1, T2???

if one after another

void print(TreeNode* root){
    if(root->left != NULL){
        print(root->left);
    }
    print("%d",root->val);

    if(root->right != NULL){
        print(root->right);
    }

}

call this for r1 then for r2

if they mean r1 and r2 combined

int* arr = malloc(sizeof(int)*(m+n));

for(int j = 0; j< m+n ; j++){
    arr[j] = 0;
}

int k = 0;
void toarr(TreeNode* root){
    arr[k]=root->val;
    k++;
    if(root->left != NULL){
        print(root->left);
    }

    if(root->right != NULL){
        print(root->right);
    }

}

toarr(r1);
toarr(r2);

then sort the array arr with some stdlib sorting algo

arr.sort()

for(int j = 0; j < m+n; j++){
    print("%d",arr[j]);
}


assuming that different parents have different children

the first solution is exactly n or m since we make one call for each node and 
one print

for the second solution it takes n+m time to insert into the array,
again exactly one call for each node and one insertion

then sorting the array, asussing with quicksort takes nlogn on average but (n+m)² worst case


then iterating again for the final print is m+n so 


worst case: O(m+n)+O((m+n)²) = O((m+n)²)
average case: O(log(m+n)) + O(m+n)=O(m+n)

best case : O(m+n) because no sorting need to happen

Exercise 4.1

so we start at vertex 5

we have three neighbours but can choose only one, we use the convention that 
we alwys select the first k (here 2) elements in ascending order

so our bfs tree loks like 

(5,1),(5,4) on between level 0 and 1

then for vertex 1

(1,2), (1,3)

then for vertex 4 
(4,7)

then we return to 5 and repeat the beam search for the remaining nodes

(5,6) though its not clear if this is intended (repeating until all nodes 
are visited)


Task 4.2

thats basically a DFS algorithm ...

(1,2),(1,3),(3,7),(7,4),(4,5),(5,6)

Task 4.3

beam(x,k):
    // ned this for very first call
    if x.visited == 0:
        print(x)
        x.visited = 1
    for i= 0 to k:
        x.adj[i].visited  =1
        print(x.adj[i])


    for i=0 to k:
        beam(x.adj[i],k)

need to do it in this way because of the order of the call stack


Exercise 5.1

its 1

exercise 5.2 

table is :


0,0,0,0
0,1,1,1
0,1,1,3
0,1,1,3
0,1,1,3

5.3 

we need to think about the relationships between the partial solutions


invariant: 

dp[i][j] is the maximum sum of a subsequence of A[0..i-1] and dp[i][j]\leq just

this gives
dp1[i][j] = A[i]+dp[i-1][j], if A[i]+dp[i-1][j] \leq j otherwise 
dp1[i][j] = dp[i][j]


dp[i][j] = max(dp1[i][j],dp[i][j-1])



task 5.4

On the one hand we need to compute the table, then
we need to store the according subsequences and finally 
compute the smallest possible M by using the subsequence of the 
dp entry which is closest to S/2
